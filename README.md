# Smart-Car-Parking-System
We have implemented a Smart Car Parking System which enables car drivers to get in and out of
the parking lot without human help. We have installed an LCD to provide a better view of the parking
area which shows the positions of vacant and occupied slots in the parking area. Also, it shows how
many slots in total are unoccupied.
Components Used
1. Arduino UNO
2. IR Sensors â€“ 5 Nos.
3. Servo Motor
4. Base Shield
5. RGB Backlight LCD (16 X 2)
6. Connecting Jumper Wires
7. Toy cars for Demo
